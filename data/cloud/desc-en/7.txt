Cirrus clouds are thin, white, soft clouds. Cirrus clouds are made up of small ice crystals because they usually appear at altitudes above 6km, where it is cold and there is very little water vapor. Cirrus clouds often form in clear weather. They can also form ahead of warm fronts and major storms like hurricanes and tropical cyclones, so seeing them can also mean a storm is on the way.
