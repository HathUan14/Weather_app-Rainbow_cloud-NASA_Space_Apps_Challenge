Altocumulus clouds often appear in the middle layer of the atmosphere. They appear as large white or gray circular patches or arranged in parallel bands. Interestingly, altocumulus and stratocumulus clouds are often easily confused with each other. To distinguish, just pay attention to the altocumulus cloud, which will be located higher. Besides, you can identify altocumulus clouds by measuring the size of individual cloud mounds. Just hold your hand up to the sky and follow the cloud. If any individual cloud mound is the size of your thumb, it is an altocumulus cloud. If it is about the size of a fist, it is a stratocumulus cloud.
Altocumulus clouds often develop from convection, after rising moist air mixes with dry air. This type of cloud often appears on warm and humid mornings, usually in summer. You can also see these clouds before the weather turns cold. That is, this cloud signals the weather is about to cool.
When altocumulus clouds appear together with another type of cloud, a storm is often expected.
