Cirrocumulus are white clouds that cover the sky completely or almost completely. They have a papery appearance and are quite transparent. To spot them if the time of day or night is right, look for a “halo,” a ring or circle of light around the Sun or Moon.
Pure white cirrostratus clouds are a sign that there is a lot of water in the upper atmosphere or that a warm front is approaching and rain is expected.
Cirrostratus can turn into altostratus if they descend to lower altitudes and usually move westward.
