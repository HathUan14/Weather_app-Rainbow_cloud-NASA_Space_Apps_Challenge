Cumulonimbus is one of the few clouds that covers all three layers. They are dense and look like cumulus clouds but grow in vertical towers with cauliflower-like tops.
It is often associated with atmospheric irregularities and is formed by water vapor carried up by strong air currents.
The tops of cumulonimbus clouds are always shaped like an anvil or a plume. They are usually opaque and dark at the bottom.
Cumulus clouds are thunderstorm clouds so if you see one, heavy rain may be coming, usually in short bursts but accompanied by extreme weather such as hail, lightning or tornadoes.
Cumulus clouds are particularly common in the afternoons of the summer and spring months.
