These are the “classic and most common” type of cloud. When the sun shines on them, their tops are round, puffy and bright white, while their bottoms are flat and mostly dark. The shape of cumulus clouds is quite similar to cauliflowers. The clouds form on sunny, clear days when the sun shines directly on the ground (diurnal convection). Therefore, they are called “good weather, fair weather” clouds. Cumulus clouds tend to appear in the late morning, develop and then disappear by late afternoon.
