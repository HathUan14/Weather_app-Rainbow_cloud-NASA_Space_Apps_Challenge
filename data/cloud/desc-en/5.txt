When the sky darkens, it is most likely due to the presence of nimbostratus clouds. These can reach into the lower and middle layers of the atmosphere, and are typically thick enough to block out sunlight. Nimbostratus clouds are generally irregular in shape, have no distinctive shape, and are usually a dull gray color.
Nimbostratus are the most common type of precipitation cloud. You will see them when it is about to rain or snow over a large area.
They form due to the accumulation of moisture over a large area when warm, moist air is lifted higher in the atmosphere and then condenses. They also form from other types of clouds, such as altostratus.
