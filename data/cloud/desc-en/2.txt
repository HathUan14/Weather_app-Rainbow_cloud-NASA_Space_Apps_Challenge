Stratus clouds look like flat, uniform layers of grey clouds that hang in the sky. They look like a layer of mist around the horizon. Stratus clouds form from large masses of air that rise and then condense. They are common on grey, cloudy days and sometimes the weather can be foggy or light drizzle. If enough moisture is trapped at ground level, the cloud can transform into a nimbostratus cloud.
