Cumulus is like using a knife to split cumulus clouds in the sky. They are characterized by low, fluffy, grayish or white clouds that appear in patches across the blue sky.
When viewed from below, they look like dark honeycombs or a white cotton blanket. They are similar in appearance to cumulus clouds but larger.
Cumulus is most visible on cloudy days. They form when there is weak convection in the air and do not tend to produce precipitation
