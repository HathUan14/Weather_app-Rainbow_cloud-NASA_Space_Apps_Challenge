Altitudes: 6,000-12,000m (20,000-40,000 ft).

Cirrocumulus are small, white clouds that often hang in rows and hover high. Like cirrostratus, they are also made up of ice crystals. They are much smaller than the mounds of altocumulus and stratocumulus. They do not carry precipitation. Although cumulus clouds do not last long, you can see them in winter or when it is cold but clear. They can look a bit like altocumulus but are more uniform in color. Cirrocumulus clouds often appear after cirrus clouds in a warm front system but they do not interact with other clouds to form larger clouds
